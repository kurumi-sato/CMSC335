App Description:
Our app is just a form that allows input on their current CMSC335 class. It just asks them basic questions such as their gpa, year, reason they took the class and then an additional fun question asking the user to add a drawing of their favorite animal. This will not show up on the confirmation page. The form will also show a list of students in the class with their year.
