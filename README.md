App Description:
Our app is a form that for new CMSC335 students. It just asks them basic questions such as their gpa, year, reason they took the class and then an additional fun question asking the user to add a drawing of their favorite animal. The drawing will not show up on the confirmation page. The form will also show a list of students in the class with their year. There is also a button remove all of the students in the database.
